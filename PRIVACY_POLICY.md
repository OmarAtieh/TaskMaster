## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how TaskMaster ("we," "our," or "the application") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our personal productivity application. TaskMaster is designed with privacy as a priority, utilizing Google Sheets for data storage directly in your personal Google Drive.

All information is:

### Google Authentication

TaskMaster requires Google authentication to:

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

TaskMaster does not share your data with any third parties. Your information:
- Remains exclusively in your Google Drive

- Is not accessed by the application developers

The only data sharing that occurs is between your devices when synchronizing through your own Google account.
